# Item-List-Creator-for-Unity
A toot that I designed to help me building a game. I made it to help me to create and modify JSON txt files to store Items informations.

What is Item List Creator?

Item List Creator is a tool made to create and manage lists of items. Every list is serialized in JSON so 
you can reuse it at any time. You can create a multitude of lists and manage them separately. This
tool allows you to see the content of your lists and edit them quickly so you don’t have to modify a 
real JSON file and worry about the structure and rules of this format. The way the Item class is made 
make it easy to save and load data for your players.

Why you made this tool?
When I was working on my own game I wanted to add an inventory system. To make it easy for the 
future I made it using Serialized data and JSON format for easy save/load system. But I got tired of 
modifying my 200 items text files… So I made this little tool to help me work on these huge lists.

What does the package come with?
The Item List Creator package include a demo scene, a small inventory system to show you how you 
can implement lists made with the tool in your game, this guide and the tool itself.

What can I do with the tool?
You can:
 Create/Load lists of items
 Create/Modify/Delete items
 Set IDs for every item automatically 
 Check if every ID in your file is unique
 Sort your list by ID/Name
 Export your list as CSV file for readability
